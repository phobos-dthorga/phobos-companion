# D'thorga Companion changelog

Maintained from 9 November 2026.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-09

Where each game was left, so changing games doesn't lose the thread (owner, 9 November 2026). Not yet tested on screen.

### Added

- The home page answers "where was I?" for every game on your list, most recently worked on first.
- For each game: when you last worked on it, the last thing you did, files left uncommitted, the latest work across its repositories, what isn't released yet, and open work where a repository keeps a list.
- A repository that can't be read is named with what to do about it, and the rest of the page still shows.
- Look again reads everything afresh and says when it did.
- Your list of games lives in .local/games.json, and config/games.example.json shows the shape.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-09

The frame for one desktop program over every game's tools (owner, 9 November 2026). Not yet tested on screen.

### Added

- A dark window with five bands: command bar, observation bar, navigator, canvas and inspector, with a status bar.
- The House D'thorga theme, held to contrast rules by a test.
- The window reads the pinned phobos-modkit 1.0.0's manifest and says how many tools it found, or what went wrong and what to do.
- Words in one catalogue, with a test that every key exists and is used.
- One command for every check: python scripts/check-all.py.
