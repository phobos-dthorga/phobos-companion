# D'thorga Companion changelog

Maintained from 9 November 2026.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-11-09

The tools' reports in the window, chosen by the question they answer, with nothing to type (owner, 9 November 2026). Not yet tested on screen.

### Added

- A Reports page, listing for the chosen game the reports that only read and need nothing typed, 19 of them for RimWorld, each named as a question.
- Reports show their words, lists, tables and text in the window, and a report that fails says what happened and offers another go.
- Click a table heading to sort it: numbers as numbers, words A to Z, and click again to reverse.
- Show more brings in the rows a long table left out.
- Copy as command puts the report's command on the clipboard, to paste into a console or a session.

### Changed

- Uses phobos-modkit 1.1.0.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-09

Where each game was left, so changing games doesn't lose the thread (owner, 9 November 2026). Not yet tested on screen.

### Added

- The home page answers "where was I?" for every game on your list, most recently worked on first.
- For each game: when you last worked on it, the last thing you did, files left uncommitted, the latest work across its repositories, what isn't released yet, and open work where a repository keeps a list.
- A repository that can't be read is named with what to do about it, and the rest of the page still shows.
- Look again reads everything afresh and says when it did.
- Your list of games lives in .local/games.json, and config/games.example.json shows the shape.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-09

The frame for one desktop program over every game's tools (owner, 9 November 2026). Not yet tested on screen.

### Added

- A dark window with five bands: command bar, observation bar, navigator, canvas and inspector, with a status bar.
- The House D'thorga theme, held to contrast rules by a test.
- The window reads the pinned phobos-modkit 1.0.0's manifest and says how many tools it found, or what went wrong and what to do.
- Words in one catalogue, with a test that every key exists and is used.
- One command for every check: python scripts/check-all.py.
